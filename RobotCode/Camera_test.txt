#Connect to a cognex camera, tested on UR Firmware 1.8 and 3.3

### Configuration of camera settings, adjust where needed ###
port = 10000
ip = "192.168.0.20"
socket_name = "Cognex"


### Connect to camera and return status ###
socket = socket_open(ip, port, socket_name)	
textmsg("Verbinding gelukt?: ", socket)

receive = socket_read_string(socket_name)
textmsg(receive)

socket_send_string("admin" , socket_name)
socket_send_byte([13,10], socket_name)

receive = socket_read_string(socket_name)
textmsg(receive)
	
### UR / Cognex weirdness. You can't send the list of bytes if you have an empty string, so we just send them separately
socket_send_string("", socket_name) # It is an empty string, you could skip this step


socket_send_byte(13, socket_name)
socket_send_byte(10, socket_name)

receive = socket_read_string(socket_name)
textmsg(receive)


### Start workloop ###
  
while (True) :
  
	### Trigger camera, only works if camera is in ONLINE mode
  
	textmsg("Sending trigger")
  	socket_send_line("SW8", socket_name)
  	socket_send_byte([13, 10], socket_name)

  	triggerstatus = socket_read_string(socket_name) 

	if triggerstatus == "1": 
		textmsg("Trigger successful: ", triggerstatus)
	else:
		textmsg("Trigger failed: ", triggerstatus)
	end
	
	sleep(1) #Just to be sure, this can probably be removed


 	### Receive datastring from camera
  
  	textmsg("Requesting coordinates")
  
  	socket_send_line("GVB021", socket_name)
  	socket_send_byte([13, 10], socket_name)

	# On Firmware 1.8 you don’t have the function socket_read_line
	# Because of this you get a response from the camera that looks like:
	# 1
	# (12.0080, 24.1234, 78.5424)
	# The socket_read_ascii_float can’t handle the status code (the “1” from line one)
	# With the function socket_read_binary_integer you can cut off the first 2 characters
	# That will be the 1 and the parentheses “1(“
	# So now we lost the opening parentheses, which is bad!
	# The socket_read_ascii_float function will really ONLY work if you get the
	# expected format. This format is “(12.0080, 24.1234, 78.5424)” Without the “”
	# To fix this you add a leading character to the data string in Cognex. You will then
	# receive
	# 1
	# ?(12.0080, 24.1234, 78.5424)
	# Note the leading question mark, but it can be any character
	# 
	# Expected format of data string will be: “?(x, y, z)” where x, y, and z are floats or 
	# integers
	# 
		
	socket_read_binary_integer(1, socket_name)
  	rec=socket_read_ascii_float(1, socket_name)

	### On firmware 3.3 the socket_read_ascii_float function doesn’t read all data
	# from the camera. Uncomment the next line or else the triggerstatus will break
	# If you are running 3.3 firmware please just use the other script!
	# buf = socket_read_string(socket_name)

    	textmsg("Ontvangen string", rec)
end

### If you break the loop and end the program, close the socket
socket_close(socket_name)
